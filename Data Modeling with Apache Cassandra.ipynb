    "## Introduction\n",
    "A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. The data reside in a directory of CSV files (event_data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the project is to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions given to by the analytics team. This project aims to create an ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables."
